# Challenge 1: Creating an Online Portfolio üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

GitHub provides features for creating an online portfolio for **free**!

An online portfolio is a great way to showcase your projects you have done (school projects, personal projects, open source contributions, etc.) and demonstrating the technical skills you have acquired throughout your tech journey.

In this challenge, you will be creating an online profile and hosting a personal site using GitHub.

## GitHub Profile READMEs

**Profile READMEs** are a convenient space to share information about yourself, right from your GitHub Profile page! You can introduce yourself and showcase your projects at the same time.

You can include anything in your Profile README, such as your current interests, your educational background, a summary of projects you are working on, social media links, etc.

Profile READMEs are written using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that aims to make writing content on the internet easier. Typically, Markdown files have the `.md` file extension.

If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, you may visit [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to start learning the basic syntax.

Otherwise, here's a crash course of the most commonly used Markdown elements:

**GitHub Pages** is a quick and easy way to host a static site for free. You can use this site as an online resume and/or showcase your past and current projects.

Pages uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript files from your specified GitHub repositories and publishes them. Once the site is published, you can access it at `https://<username>.github.io`.

GitHub Pages also optionally supports [custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages), so you can access your site from any domain that you own.

To learn more about GitHub Pages, you may visit the [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

### Challenge 1.2: Host Your Portfolio with GitHub Pages

***Host an online portfolio site using GitHub Pages to introduce yourself.***

You may follow [this guide](https://pages.github.com/) to get started.

You can either:

1. Host your CodePen site on GitHub Pages

If you are hosting your CodePen site, you may [follow this guide](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/exporting-pens/) to export your code, and then push it to your GitHub repository of choice.

If you are creating a new site, you may consider using [GitHub's built-in themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser) and modifying the contents.
